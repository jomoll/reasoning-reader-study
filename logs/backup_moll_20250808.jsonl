However, in the upper chest, a linear radiopaque structure consistent with an ETT can be seen descending within the tracheal air column.\",\n      \"The next step is to determine the position of the ETT tip relative to the carina. The carina, the bifurcation of the trachea, is difficult to definitively locate due to the extensive opacification and poor image quality. However, its approximate location is typically at the T4-T5 vertebral level. The ETT can be traced inferiorly.\",\n      \"Upon tracing the ETT, it appears to deviate towards the patient's right side and enter the right mainstem bronchus. The tip of the tube is not positioned in the mid-trachea above the carina. This is known as a right mainstem intubation.\",\n      \"A right mainstem intubation means the tube has been advanced too far inferiorly, past the carina. This constitutes a malposition. The consequence of this is often atelectasis (collapse) of the non-ventilated left lung, which is consistent with the extensive opacification seen on the left side of the chest. Therefore, relative to a correct position, the tube is 'too low'.\"\n    ],\n    \"external_influence\": \"The suggestion 'right' from another radiologist prompted me to specifically look for evidence of a right mainstem intubation.
